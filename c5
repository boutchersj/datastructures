//The '.splice()' method takes 3 arguments, but this challenge focuses on the first 2
//Argument 1 is the index where you start removing elements
//Argument 2 is the number of consecutive elements to remove
//Splice takes these elements out of the array, modifying that array in the process but ALSO returning the removed elements in a new array

//I just used the '.sort()' method to make this challenge easier. Not sure if there was a different way to do it with only Splice tho
